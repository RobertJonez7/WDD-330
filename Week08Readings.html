            <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>
            <br>
            Transfrom and transition are properties in CSS that allow us to create animations.
            This can create a better user expierence and really amp up your webpage to the next level.
            Below is a simple snippet a code that rotates a div by 20 degrees.
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="https://robertjonez7.github.io/WDD-330/Assets/transform.PNG">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew things on your screen. Next we have
            transitions. Transitions define how long something will take to transform and how it transforms. 
            For example, If we wanted out div to move across the screen and we wanted it to take 3 seconds,
            we could add a propert of transition: 3s. We can also add a delay to make it move 1s after we
            click something. We can make it ease-in or ease-out (Move fast at first and then slow at end and
            vice versa). Or we can customize our own cubic-bezier property.

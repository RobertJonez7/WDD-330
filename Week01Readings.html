            <h2>General Notes</h2>
            <br>
            1)	Computers are stupid, but they are good task takers. Therefore, they cannot remember user information unless directed to do so somewhere in the application.
            <br><br>
            2)	When creating the index page for my portfolio, I must use an array to dynamically put all my links onto the page without putting them into the index.html file. I have thought of many ways to do this, but I ultimately ended up using a JavaScript map, to map all the links to the screen. 
            <br><br>
            3)	Mobile first design is important; it used to be desktop design first, mobile later. Now things are changing, it has shifted to mobile design first.
            <br><br>
            4)	We want users to have the best user experience. A lot of people use mobile phones for internet searches.
            <br><br>
            5)	The turnover rate for phones is around 2 years. The turnover rate for desktops is around 4-5 years. This means mobile phones are changing at a much faster speed than desktops since more people get a new phone in a shorter span of time.
            <br><br>
            6)	Responsive retrofitting, while not terrible, does not address screen size real estate. It is hard to fit all the website on a phone that was originally designed for desktop.

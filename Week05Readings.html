            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <br>
            There are different ways to debug a JavaScript program. I have used many of these techniques
            and they all seem to be efficient. The first one I used when I was starting out was the console.log()
            which outputs something to the console. it is similar to the 'cout' in C++. I still use this, but there are other
            tool.
            <br><br>
            There are breakpoints also that are really useful also. Breakpoints are where you can actually stop
            your program and view the data that the variables hold. You can also follow the program and see how it
            executes the code. You can use this to make sure your data is being passed and processed correctly. You
            can also use the 'debugger' keyword.

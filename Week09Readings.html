            <h2>The Window Object</h2>
            <br>
            The Window Object is basically what it sounds like, an open window in a browser. With
            JavaScript we can manipulate the window to do certain things. All of our HTML and CSS will
            be rendered here. The window comes equipped with different properties like, innerHeight,
            innerWidth, localStorage and more. Also it comes with methods like alert(), print() and so much more.
            <br>

            <h2>APIs</h2>
            <br>
            API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs excel at storing data, which the browser
            can recieve and manipulate/display on the screen. A lot of APIs are located on external servers,
            so a fetch or AJAX request is required to extract the needed information. Thic can create a dynamic
            feel for your webpage.

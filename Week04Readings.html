            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <br>
            The form element is used to extract information from user inputs such as text boxes, checkboxes,
            radio buttons, etc. When a user inputs information that we want to use later, we can pass it 
            through the form element and get that information to use it later. We can use JavScript for this.

            Here are some examples of elements we can use inside of a form:

            <ul>
                <li>input type="text"</li>
                <li>input type="radio"</li>
                <li>input type="checkbox"</li>
                <li>input type="submit"</li>
                <li>input type="button"</li>
            </ul>

            Some applications for this would be in an ecommerce site. If I checked all of the stuff I wanted
            to buy, then I could use a form to send the checked boxes to the backend where we can process
            what was clicked.

            <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
            <br>
            JavaScript has added classes and we are now effictively able to use object oreiented programming.
            OOP includes: inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation. Essentially, we are able to make
            classes that represent objects, and we can use those objects throughout our program. This encourages
            DRY (Don't repeat yourself) as we are able to resuse code from those classes. Here is an example that
            I coded for reference:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="../Assets/class.PNG">
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Workshop Practice</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="../Assets/workshop4.PNG">
            </div>
        </p>

            <h2>AJAX</h2>
            <br>
            Asynchronous Javascript and XML. AJAX is not a programming language, rather it is a tool that
            helps us retrieve data from a server. AJAX uses a HTTP request to go out and fetch the required
            data. It then takes that data, and pulls it back and then we can use it on our webpage. For
            example, we can make a request to go and fetch some JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). We can then
            use that informarion and display it on the screen. This creates more dynamic webpages.
            <br><br>
            Here is a picture of the basic syntax of AJAX. I found this on W3Schools, and I feel like it
            has helped me out a lot. The syntax at first glance may seem a little complicated, but it really
            is quite straightforward. We readdy a new XMLHttpRequest, then check to see if it loaded correctly.
            If we get the correct status code, we then extract the information (Below we are getting data from
            a .txt file) and then put that information into a div that displays it on the screen.

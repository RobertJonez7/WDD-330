            -The ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript can change depending on its scope. There are six different values that ‘this’ can take on. They are:
            <br><br>
            1.	this in global context <br>
            2.	this in object construction <br>
            3.	this in an object method <br>
            4.	this in a simple function <br>
            5.	this in an arrow function <br>
            6.	this in an event listener <br>
            
            <br><br>
            -Global context: refers to window object<br>
            -Object construction context: When you use the ‘new’ keyword, ‘this’ refers to the instance.<br>
            -Object Method context: refers to the object itself<br>
            -Simple function context: refers to window object<br>
            -Arrow function context: refers to the object itself<br>
            -Event listener context: refers to the element that fired the event<br>
            <br><br>
            -DOM (Document Object Model)<br>
            -It defines what you see on the screen (The HTML elements, colors, etc.)<br>
            -JavaScript can manipulate the DOM, that is how you are able to insert/remove things on the screen using JavaScript.<br>
            <br><br>
            -Events are when things happen to HTML elements.<br>
            -One example of an event is when you click on something on a webpage. Or if you scroll down. Or if you minimize the screen. There is many events that you can utilize.<br>
            -Typically, you want something to happen when an event is fired. You can do this using addEventListener in JavaScript. Or you can add it directly to an HTML element (onclick, onchange, etc.)<br>
            <br><br>
            
            I then used the coding sandbox to solidify the concepts. I spent the most time on Chapter 15: Handling Events. I then tried to recreate the code that was there. Here are my results:

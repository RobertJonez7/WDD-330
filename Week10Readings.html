            <h2>Fetch Requests</h2>
            <br>
            Ftch requests are used to access and obtain external information, like JSON from another
            site/source. They were previously achieved by using XMHttpRequests, but fetch() is a cleaner
            version of that. There are some key differences, like fetch() won't reject HTTP error statuses,
            it can't receive cross-site cookies and it also won't send cookies. Below are two different ways to
            do a fetch request. One with promises (Using the .then syntax), and my personal favorite, the one
            using async (Using the async/await syntax)

            <h2>Form Validation</h2>
            <br>
            From validation is defensive programming, used to assure that the user enters
            the correct information into your form. This means testing so that the inputs
            aren't blank, have invalid characters/information, etc. So that everything can be
            processed correctly.
